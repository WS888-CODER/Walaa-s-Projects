Operating Systems Simulations – CPU Scheduling & Memory Allocation

We developed two Java simulations for our Operating Systems course:

CPU Scheduling (SRTF with Context Switching):
Simulates the Shortest Remaining Time First algorithm with context switch delays, using a Gantt chart to visualize execution. It calculates average waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization, showing process prioritization and preemption.

Memory Allocation Strategies (First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit):
Interactive system allowing memory allocation/deallocation using different strategies. Tracks internal fragmentation and shows detailed memory block status (size, address, allocation).

Both projects demonstrate practical application of OS concepts through Java coding and include detailed reports.
