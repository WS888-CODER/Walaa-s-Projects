Number Spy - Multiplayer Java Game

"Number Spy" is an engaging multiplayer game developed in Java using a client-server architecture for the Computer Networks course. The game challenges players to identify the outlier number pattern across 5 increasingly difficult levels.

Players first enter a waiting room, where they wait for others to join. Once the minimum number of players is reached, they are moved to the playing room and the game begins. In each round, the first player to correctly identify the unique pattern scores a point. All players then progress to the next level together. The player with the highest score at the end of the 5 rounds wins.

The system handles synchronization, room management, and real-time communication between clients using Java Sockets. The project showcases our practical understanding of client-server communication, concurrency, and networked game design.
