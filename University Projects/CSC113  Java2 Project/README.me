Cake Shop
Java-Based Cake Ordering Interface

This project is a user-friendly Java application designed as an interface for purchasing and ordering cakes from our bakery. The process starts when the user clicks the “Make Order” button, which prompts them to enter their personal information.

Next, the user selects the number of cakes they want to order, followed by customizing their cakes by choosing flavors, layers, cake types, and sizes according to their preferences.

Once the customization is complete, the user receives a detailed invoice summarizing the full order, including prices. Additionally, the interface allows users to cancel the entire order or remove specific items from it before final confirmation.

This project demonstrates skills in Java GUI development, user input validation, and dynamic order processing to provide a smooth and interactive customer experience.
