In this project, we applied IT project management methodologies to plan Roletopia, a VR educational platform for children. I gained deep insights into the 10 Knowledge Areas of Project Management (PMBOK), ensuring every phase was meticulously planned. My contributions included scope and schedule management through WBS development, cost estimation using the COCOMO model, and quality assurance planning. I also participated in risk management by identifying technical threats and creating mitigation strategies, alongside stakeholder communication planning. This project solidified my ability to handle the "Triple Constraint" (Scope, Time, and Cost) and enhanced my skills in strategic leadership and technical documentation for complex IT initiatives.
