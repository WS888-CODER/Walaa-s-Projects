What are the most [Top-rated movies on IMDb]
As part of our Data Science project at King Saud University, we analyzed over 18,000 movies and TV shows to identify what makes a film highly rated and widely watched. We collected data from TMDb and Kaggle, cleaned and explored it using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

We examined how different factors—such as IMDb ratings, votes, runtime, genre, and release year—impact a movie's success. Through correlation matrices, visualizations, and regression modeling (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost), we uncovered insights like:

Multi-genre films and longer runtimes often receive higher ratings and more votes.

Certain genres like Animation and Documentaries tend to perform better.

Audience engagement has shifted over decades, influenced by digital platforms.

Our final models accurately predicted movie popularity using features like genre and runtime, with XGBoost delivering the best performance. This project sharpened our skills in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, machine learning, and storytelling with data.
