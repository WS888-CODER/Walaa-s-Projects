Data Mining – Diabetes Risk Prediction
Project: Data Mining – Diabetes Risk Prediction
This project was completed for the Data Mining course using a real-world dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to build a machine learning model that predicts an individual’s risk of developing diabetes by leveraging both clustering and classification techniques. We used Python for implementation and hosted the project on GitHub to ensure accessibility and transparency.

Our workflow included data preprocessing, feature selection, and applying models such as K-Means for clustering and Decision Tree classification using Gini Index. The model achieved over 90% accuracy, reflecting its strong predictive power.

This was a collaborative project, and my key contributions were focused on the classification part, handling the Gini Index, and performing preprocessing tasks. I also authored a detailed technical report documenting the process and findings.

The project demonstrates the real-world application of data mining concepts and can benefit healthcare professionals, students, and researchers interested in predictive analytics.
