Simple Search Engine using Java & Data Structures

We built a basic search engine in pure Java using custom data structures, simulating how real-world search engines operate.

It begins by reading documents from CSV files and processing the text (tokenizing, lowercasing, removing stopwords and punctuation). Then, we implemented:

Index: Maps documents to words.

Inverted Index (List-based): Maps words to document IDs.

Inverted Index (BST-based): Optimized using Binary Search Trees.

The engine supports Boolean Queries (AND/OR) and Ranked Retrieval using Term Frequency (TF).

We also created a simple user interface to:

Run Boolean or Ranked Searches

View index statistics

Compare performance across data structures

This project reflects strong knowledge of algorithms, information retrieval, and Big-O analysis .
