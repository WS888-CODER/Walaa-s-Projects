Database Design & Implementation for Le Méridien Hotel

This project involved designing and implementing a complete database system for Le Méridien Hotel. The process started with creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that includes five key entities:

Customer

Booking

Room

Branch

Services

Each entity was defined with its primary key and relevant attributes.

We then wrote the complete relational schema, followed by creating a comprehensive data dictionary that defines all entities, attributes, and relationships.

After the design phase, we implemented the full database in Oracle, creating all required tables. Finally, we developed a basic user interface connected to the database for easier interaction and management.

This project showcases skills in data modeling, SQL, and Oracle database systems, along with a focus on real-world hotel management use cases.
