Security
As part of our IT Security course, we explored multiple real-world security practices through the following key tasks:

Digital Certificate & Email Encryption: We created a digital certificate and used it to securely sign and encrypt an email, demonstrating the importance of authentication and confidentiality in communication.

Password Cracking: We performed password cracking using both dictionary and brute-force attacks, providing hands-on experience with common cybersecurity threats.

VPN Research & Wireshark Demo: We conducted a full research on VPNs and practically analyzed network packets using Wireshark—before and after enabling a VPN—to prove how effectively VPNs protect users’ data over public networks.

💡 Tip: Always enable a VPN when using public Wi-Fi to ensure your browsing and personal data remain private.
