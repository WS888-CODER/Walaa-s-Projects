Our team developed an AI-based system to automate the classification of vehicle damages into 8 distinct categories, aiming to streamline insurance assessments and minimize human error. Our methodology focused on a comparative analysis of three different architectures: a custom CNN built from scratch, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0.
My primary contribution was the end-to-end development and training of the Custom CNN model from scratch. I was responsible for designing the network architecture, configuring layers, and performing extensive hyperparameter tuning. This role allowed me to master the complexities of manual model training, including addressing overfitting through Dropout and Data Augmentation techniques.
The project concluded with a comprehensive evaluation of performance trade-offs. DenseNet201 performed best, achieving 88.5% accuracy via transfer learning, while the custom CNN struggled (18.47% accuracy) due to the limited dataset size. This comparison provided me with deep technical insights into model selection and optimization based on dataset scale.
