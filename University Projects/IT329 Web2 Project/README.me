Wellnest Clinic Website

This project is a professional website for Wellnest Clinic that enables patients to book all available services efficiently. The platform allows users to log in as a doctor to follow up with patients and prescribe treatments, or as a patient to book appointments with various specialists.

The website is fully integrated with a robust database that securely stores patient, doctor, and staff information. It features a highly polished and responsive user interface, praised informally by the Head of the IT Department at King Saud University for its professional design and user experience.

The Rise of Voice Search Optimization
We conducted extensive research on Voice Search Optimization (VSO), exploring its definition, benefits, and supporting tools. As a demonstration, we developed a prototype website designed as a search engine for Computer Science majors at King Saud University. The website allows users to search either by typing or using voice commands, then displays detailed information about the chosen major. The project highlights the significance of voice search technologies in enhancing user experience and making information more accessible and interactive.
