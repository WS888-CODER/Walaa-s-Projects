The Rise of Voice Search Optimization
We conducted extensive research on Voice Search Optimization (VSO), exploring its definition, benefits, and supporting tools. As a demonstration, we developed a prototype website designed as a search engine for Computer Science majors at King Saud University. The website allows users to search either by typing or using voice commands, then displays detailed information about the chosen major. The project highlights the significance of voice search technologies in enhancing user experience and making information more accessible and interactive.
